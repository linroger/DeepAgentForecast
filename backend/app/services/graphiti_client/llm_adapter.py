"""Provider-agnostic Graphiti LLM client backed by the app's own ``LLMClient``.

Graphiti needs an LLM to extract entities/edges from episodes and return schema-conforming
JSON. Rather than bind Graphiti to one provider, we delegate to the app's existing
``app.utils.llm_client.LLMClient``, which already supports every configured provider
(claude-cli / codex-cli / openai / kimi / minimax / deepseek / qwen / glm), with
disable-thinking handling, Kimi User-Agent injection, retries, and JSON repair.

This means local graph building works with whatever provider the user configured —
including the no-API-key CLI providers — and needs NO embeddings endpoint (embeddings are
handled separately by the local sentence-transformers embedder).

The Graphiti base ``LLMClient.generate_response`` already injects the response model's JSON
schema and a multilingual instruction into the messages before calling ``_generate_response``,
so here we only translate messages and invoke the app client's ``chat_json``.

# R2-EXEC-1: dedicated I/O thread pool for the blocking graphiti LLM HTTP calls.
#
# Graphiti drives episode extraction by awaiting ``_generate_response`` from the
# runtime's single bg event loop. Each call offloads a *blocking* ``chat_json``
# POST onto a thread via ``loop.run_in_executor``. Previously this passed
# ``None`` → the asyncio DEFAULT ThreadPoolExecutor, whose size is
# ``min(32, os.cpu_count()+4)`` (~12-20 on typical hosts) and which is SHARED with
# every other ``run_in_executor`` user (incl. the embedder's CPU encode). That
# shared, ~20-slot pool is the hard ceiling that silently caps GRAPH_BUILD_CONCURRENCY
# × GRAPHITI_MAX_COROUTINES no matter how high those knobs are set — the wedge root.
#
# A dedicated, larger pool (GRAPH_LLM_EXECUTOR_WORKERS, default 64) lets the
# concurrency knobs actually reach the proxy. Lazily built, process-global, and
# exposed via an accessor so every AppGraphitiLLMClient instance shares ONE pool.
