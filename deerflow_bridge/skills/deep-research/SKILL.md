name: deep-research
description: Use for web research, comparisons, explanations that depend on external evidence, and every forecast investigation. Provides the always-on core for KIQ decomposition, source grading, evidence-yield stopping, disconfirmation, forecast inputs, provenance, and phase-aware handoffs. Detailed tradecraft and the final-dossier contract live in lazy references.

# Deep Research — Core Contract

Produce decision-grade research: real fetched evidence, graded provenance, explicit uncertainty, and forecast-useful structure. This core is intentionally compact because `/deep-research` may be activated in every independent pass.

## Activation discipline

When this body is injected, do **not** reread `SKILL.md`; it is already in the
conversation. Load only a named lazy reference when the phase needs it.

## Phase type comes first

Identify the current phase from its prompt. The phase contract overrides any final-output rule:

- **Working phases** — opening/source-map notes, scoped worker notes, KIQ top-ups, verification notes, actor passes, correction messages, and fan-out absorption. Return concise evidence-ledger notes and gaps. **They are explicitly exempt from every final word-count, section-count, and polished-dossier floor.** Do not pad or synthesize the final report.
- **Final dossier synthesis only** — the prompt explicitly says to write/synthesize/finalize the complete research dossier. Only this phase uses the long-form output contract in `references/final-dossier-contract.md`.
- **Structured extraction/judging** — follow the requested JSON/scorecard schema, not the prose length contract.

This distinction is mandatory. A global dossier floor applied to every pass multiplies latency and tokens.

## Core loop

1. Decompose the brief into 3–7 Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs). Mark load-bearing KIQs, likely S1/S2 source classes, priors, and what would falsify them.
2. Search for documents, not commentary. Use `web_search`, then `web_fetch` the strongest pages in full. For forecast calibration use `prediction_market_search`; if unavailable, use read-only `web_fetch` against the public Gamma API. Run the full market sweep **once, in the opening pass**; if it surfaces zero topically relevant markets, record `no_market_coverage` and skip market search in later phases (one refresh at synthesis only). A transport-failing market tool must not be retried within the same phase.
3. Maintain an evidence ledger: `KIQ → claim → source/title/real URL/date/tier → independence → grade → open gap`.
4. Prefer primary origins, verify numbers/units/as-of dates, trace repeated claims back to their origin, and seek the strongest opposing case.
5. Check convergence after every evidence-bearing call. Continue only for a named unresolved KIQ with a credible next upgrade.
6. Before final synthesis, verify the synthesis gate and load the final-dossier reference.

## Evidence discipline

- **S1**: original/authoritative material — official statistics, filings, laws, court records, peer-reviewed papers, transcripts, primary datasets, direct first-party statements. Preferred for load-bearing facts.
- **S2**: accountable high-quality reporting/analysis — major wires/outlets, serious trade press, established research bodies. Context and a pointer to S1.
- **S3**: conditional/biased/derivative — vendor research, expert blogs, preprints, Wikipedia as a map. Corroborate or attribute explicitly.
- **S4**: reject — SEO/affiliate slop, anonymous/undated aggregators, unsupported statistics, synthetic rewrites. Do not fetch or cite.

Only cite sources actually fetched and read. Preserve their true URL and on-page date. Never invent a title, URL, market, quote, or future-dated document. Two outlets repeating one underlying report are one origin, not triangulation.

For each quantitative fact record the metric, value/range, unit, as-of date, definition, geography/population, and source URL. Sanity-check magnitude, currency, nominal/real basis, denominators, totals, and compounding.

For detailed query operators, document targeting, source maps, grading, number checks, adversarial analysis, and obstacle routing, load:

`references/source-tradecraft.md`

## KIQ and evidence-yield stopping

Tool counts and source counts are safety telemetry, never quotas or quality proxies.

- **KIQ done**: each load-bearing claim is B2-or-better and its strongest plausible opposing case was checked; or accessible S1/S2 paths are exhausted and the remaining gap is explicit.
- **Evidence delta**: a new independent origin, stronger tier, verified number, resolved contradiction, reference-class base rate, watchable indicator, or genuine disconfirmation.
- **Yield stop**: two genuinely different angles produce no evidence delta. Stop that line and record the gap.
- **Continue**: at least one priority KIQ remains unresolved and the next call has a named expected upgrade.
- Never issue a near-duplicate query. Change actor, mechanism, document type, jurisdiction/language, or time window—not punctuation.
- Checkpoint the ledger after every pass; later phases must not re-research settled items.

## Forecast-specific requirements

Research forecasting inputs, not only present-state description:

- outside-view reference classes and base rates;
- named actors, stated versus revealed behavior, incentives, capabilities, constraints, and what each gains/loses;
- directed typed relationships among key actors, each with an evidence basis;
- causal drivers, countervailing forces, catalysts, and second-order effects;
- dated timeline and forecast horizon;
- explicit competing scenarios/hypotheses and disconfirming evidence;
- watchable indicators with thresholds/dates;
- chart-ready tables/series with definitions and provenance;
- prediction-market question, market ID, P(yes), volume/liquidity, end date, URL, and fetch time for relevant liquid markets.

Market prices are calibration anchors, not ground truth; self-filter lexical false positives and explain material divergence rather than copying the price.

## Synthesis gate

Final synthesis may begin only when:

- every priority KIQ is resolved or explicitly flagged;
- load-bearing claims are B2-or-better or visibly labeled weak/single-origin;
- key numbers, dates, quotes, and citation origins were checked;
- circular sourcing was removed;
- disconfirmation, key assumptions, and competing hypotheses were tested;
- forecasts have base rates, actor incentives, chart-ready evidence, and indicators.

If one item fails, run one targeted gap pass. Do not restart broad research.

## Final synthesis routing

When—and only when—the prompt requests the complete final research dossier, load and follow:

`references/final-dossier-contract.md`

That reference contains the long-form completeness floor, structured handoff fields, citations, scenarios, market section, tables, conflicts, and failure checklist; working phases must not load or inherit its length floor.
